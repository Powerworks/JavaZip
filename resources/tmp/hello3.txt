Hello,
All ten of our connectors are failing to sync.  Please help!
Thanks,
John Doe



Troubleshooting steps.

1. Respond to John and tell him that you are looking into it right away.

2. Check is there a service outage on the Fivetran IP used by the client https://status.fivetran.com/

3. Check the account on FiveTran, is it a trial/full account is PAYG or annuall contract, 
is there a payment owing. Is there credits remaining?

4. It may be worth calling the client and guide them through how to check the logs..
 dashboard logs to see what the failure message is.
 If the client is unreachable, and it is permitted - check what the error messages are 
 from FiveTran for the client. ( I am not sure if Support can access this or only visible on the Client side)
 
 
5. Depending on the result of 4 
 5a. Check if your Firewall settings have changed and may be now preventing Fivetran from accessing. 
 5b. Check if your database is blocking Fivetran's access via permission changes. 
 5c. Run some checks on sync start and end times and troubleshhot errors and warnings 
 https://fivetran.com/docs/logs/fivetran-log/sample-queries#checkconnectorstatus
 5d. Check if there is issues with destination (eg no disk space or memory)
 
6. From the logs review previous similar tickets
 
4. Ask the client to check dashboard / external 

Check the status for the customer on FiveTran server, server logs, connector logs.
