Assume that you provided a workaround for a bug. The customer is not 
satisfied with the workaround and indicates that our engineering team needs 
to re-prioritize the issue and provide an immediate fix since 
it is affecting their business. 
However, our engineering is guaranteeing a fix will be deployed at the end of 
the quarter. Please provide your response to the customer.


Greetings bro,




I can understand you want this issue resolved immediately however we need to 
through the correct proper assessment, fix, test and deploy strategy so we 
correctly address the issue.
The last thing we want to do is apply an incomplete fix and have the problem perist.
As I have been informed by the developers, it is scheduled to be fixed in the next quarter,
kindly use the workaround as provided until then to minimize the impact on your workflow.
